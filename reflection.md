Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

- My class represents a Marvel-inspired superhero, focusing on their ability to make, track, and fulfill promises.  
- I implemented additional methods like `toString` for a descriptive summary of the hero and `fulfillPromise` to handle fulfilling promises.  
- The structure and functionality worked well, but designing meaningful interactions took some planning; my advice is to start small, understand interfaces, and incrementally add features.
